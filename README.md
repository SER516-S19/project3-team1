# Project 3 Team 1: QuizApp  

## Building  

`maven package`  
This project is built by maven using multiple executions layered into a general build.  
As of now I have not determined a way to build just the student or professor applications.  

## Running  

The jar files are located in `target/` after compilation.  
Student: `java -jar target/StudentApp.jar`  
Professor: `java -jar target/ProfessorApp.jar`
